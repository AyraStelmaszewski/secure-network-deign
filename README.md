Your company faces an exciting challenge: designing a secure and efficient network for a client relocating to a new office. Their current setup requires modernization, and you're tasked with crafting a cost-effective, well-structured plan that optimizes resource allocation while adhering to stringent security best practices.


- ISCSI ; iSCSI (Internet Small Computer System Interface) is a protocol used for establishing and managing connections between storage devices (such as disk arrays or tape drives) over an IP network. It allows for the remote mounting of storage devices as if they were locally attached.

In Packet Tracer, which is a network simulation tool, the iSCSI storage server is typically represented by a generic server device or a storage device that supports iSCSI protocol. It might not have a specific icon representing it, but you can configure a device to act as an iSCSI storage server by enabling the iSCSI services and configuring storage resources accordingly. It's important to note that Packet Tracer may not provide a detailed representation of all specific server types or protocols but is used for basic networking simulations.
